This is a repository to examin Github's math formula rendering [Math support in Markdown](https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/).
The first math formula is the definition of the Riemann zeta function: $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}$, $\Re(s)>1$.
This function admits meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. Its functional equation is of the form:
$$
Z(1 - s) = Z(s),
$$
where the *completed* zeta function $Z(s)$ is defined as:
$$
Z(s) = \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}} \Gamma(s) \zeta(s).
$$
